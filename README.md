## Description
This introductory project for CIS566 (Procedural Graphics) involved experimentation with Typescript and WebGL to produce an animated cube decorated with procedural noise. 


## Implementation 
I averaged three 3D Perlin Noise functions together at different frequencies and used the resulting value to pick a color from a gradient. These colors are based on the user's input color, and vary in transparency. The further from the camera z-position the fragments are, the more faded the noise becomes. I also have a control to turn on or off animation, which will move each vertex along a sine wave in the direction of its normal.
